        âœ… Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can also rub your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. It should be at least 60% alcohol.  
        âœ… Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.  
        âœ… Cover your cough or sneeze with your bent elbow or a tissue. Throw it away after you\'ve used it.  
        âœ… Avoid contact with infected people. Stay at least 1-meter away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. 
        âœ… Stay at home if you feel ill. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, phone your health worker.
