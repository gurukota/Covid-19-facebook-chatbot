        What is the difference between testing and screening for COVID-19?
        
        Screening: People get screened to find out whether they\'re at risk of getting the virus. They\'ll be asked questions about their recent activities and health. People can also get screened through temperature scanners which helps identify symptoms like a fever.
        
        Testing: This includes collecting a biological sample from a suspected patient like a nasal swab or blood sample which gets sent to a laboratory. At the lab, the sample is tested for the virus or its antibodies.
